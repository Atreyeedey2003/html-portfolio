<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3><em>Barfi</em></h3>
<p>Starring Ranbir Kapoor, Ileana D'Cruz and Priyanka Chopra. A 2012 film directed by Anurag Basu. Three young people learn that love can neither be defined nor contained by society's definition of normal and abnormal. </p>
<h3><em>Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani</em></h3>
<p>About friendship and love (and also a trip to Manali!). I have probably watched this movie more than 20 times now.</p>
<h3><em>Sonar Kella</em></h3>
<p>Directed by Satyajit Ray. A young boy becomes a target for crooks, after he claims to remember his past life and mentions precious jewels in a golden fortress.</p>
